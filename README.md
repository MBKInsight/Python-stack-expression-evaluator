# Python-stack-expression-evaluator

# Overview
This program reads mathematical expressions from an `input.txt` file, evaluates each one using a **stack-based algorithm**, and writes the results to an `output.txt` file. It demonstrates the practical use of the **stack data structure** in parsing and evaluating infix expressions.

# Objectives
- Implement stack operations (`push`, `pop`, `peek`).
- Parse and evaluate mathematical expressions using a **stack**.
- Apply the **Shunting Yard algorithm** for operator precedence and parentheses.
- Write results to an output file in the same format as the input file.

# Files Included
| File Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `evaluate_expressions.py` | Main Python program implementing stack evaluation. |
| `input.txt` | Text file containing mathematical expressions. |
| `output.txt` | Text file containing results of evaluated expressions. |

# How to Run

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or later
- PyCharm (or any Python IDE)

## Steps
1. Place `evaluate_expressions.py`, `input.txt`, and `README.md` in the **same folder**.
2. Open the project in PyCharm.
3. Right-click on `evaluate_expressions.py` → Run 'evaluate_expressions'.
4. The program will:
   - Read expressions from `input.txt`
   - Evaluate them using stacks
   - Write results to `output.txt`
